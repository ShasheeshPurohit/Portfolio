            Today I implemented some sections of the website completely on my own as a challenge in the course and that
            gave me a lot of confidence about how to design websites and to organize the content on the webpage. The
            course has taught me a lot of things such as the steps to keep in mind while designing the website, there
            are 7 things you must keep in mind to make the website more appealing to the eyes of the user:

        </p>

        <p>
            Most of your content will be text, so beautiful typography is a key element to a good looking website.
            Images are getting more and more important in webdesign, so choosing great images and putting text on them
            is an essential part of your work.
            Icons are also a good way of setting a friendly tone for your website, but use them carefully.
            The adequate use of whitespace makes a website look professionally designed, so use it a lot, but in the
            correct way.

        </p>

        <p>
            Build a layout by defining the visual hierarchy of your content. Whitespace is also important for this.
            Your website should be designed in a way that ensures that both the user and the owner of the website
            achieve their goals. This is the user experience.
            It is very important that you get inspired by studying well-designed websites from other designers.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li> As most of the content on your webpage is text, you must keep in mind to use proper texts that are more
                suitable to the genre of the website. The optimal font-size for a website would be 15px - 25px.</li>
            <li>Images are very important in the structure of the website, they must not be too much or too little, and
                they must be easily seen, such that they suit the accent of the color of the website. We must also be
                careful when using texts on images as the text should be visible hence, it is always better to make the
                image a little darker and then place light text on it.</li>
            <li>Icons play a very important role to convey the information that is written along with them and they help
                the user to easily understand the content as well as make the web site more appealing.</li>
            <li>
                White space is used to make the website look more elegant and clean. If white space is very less then
                the content looks crammed up on the webpage and if it is too much it looks unorganized and tiring for
                the user whereas a proper use of white space gives it a clean look and keeps the user navigating through
                the hierarchy properly.
            </li>

            <li>
                Building a visual hierarchy of the content is a good practice as it helps us to allot the white space
                properly and to organize the content into the various sections of the webpage.
            </li>

            <li>
                The look and the feel of the website must be such that the user enjoys using the website but we must
                also keep it in mind that the working of the website must not be affected as well. Hence, it UI and UX
                go hand in hand and both must be taken care of while designing the website.
            </li>
            <li>
                It's always good to find inspiration and keep designing new websites if you want to master web
                development, as they say, "Steal like an Artist".
            </li>
        </ol>
