            Web Development sounds fun and attractive but that's only until I came across back-end programming. I was
            always scared to enter the back-end development so I never began. Then one day I realized its just
            programming and playing with data after all. Hence I started this blog to help me stay regular on my course
            of becoming a full-stack Web Developer! as they say, you never learn unless you get your hands dirty!

        <p>
            The first two days are about refreshing your HTML skills, you might think you know it all but you never do!
            I'm currently learning from the course that is by Angela Yu. Angela Yu is the co-founder of App Brewery in
            the UK and an amazing teacher! It's amazing how she teaches everything by practically implementing it
            herself and the challenges are given in each section of the code help us to test the knowledge we've gained
            throughout the way.

            HTML is as powerful as any other language but highly under-rated! after all, you can learn various languages
            but you'll have to play around with HTML while making a layout.

            Past two days I learned about anchor tags, tables, tables inside tables! and whatnot. Coding is like maths
            i.e. you never learn until you try.

            Hoping to finish up this course as soon as possible and earn the tag of a full-stack developer!

            The next two days are about CSS!.
